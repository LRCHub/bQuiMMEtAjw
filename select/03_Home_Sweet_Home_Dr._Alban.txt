I have been everywhere
There is no place like home sweet home

A mi say once upon a time mi live a long from home
Far far from home
Far far from home
Say mi travel everywhere but home is the best
Mi no bother how nice Jah Jah know mi have to go
Ya home ya home
Lorda mercy sweet home
Ya home ya home
Lorda mercy sweet home

There is no place like home sweet home
Home, home, home sweet home

As time go on
Say me get boring cause is long from home
Long long from home

No matter where mi go
Sweet home is the best
When mi lie pan the bed
Mi think think Jah Jah know
Ya home ya home
Lorda mercy sweet home
Ya home ya home
Lorda mercy sweet home

There is no plaace like home sweet home
Home, home, home sweet home

Mother land
Our land
I, I
Mother land
Our land
I, I
