[00:13.85] You know I'm a dreamer
[00:17.52] But my heart's of gold
[00:21.38] I had to run away high
[00:24.72] So I wouldn't come home low
[00:38.22] 
[00:27.44] Just when things went right
[00:30.42] It doesn't mean they were always wrong
[00:34.04] Just take this song and you'll never feel
[00:38.22] Left all alone
[00:45.22] 
[00:39.64] Take me to your heart
[00:43.18] Feel me in your bones
[00:46.61] Just one more night
[00:48.48] And I'm comin' off this
[00:59.98] 
[00:50.78] Long and winding road
[00:56.26] I'm on my way
[00:59.24] I'm on my way
[01:01.89] Home sweet home
[01:09.39] 
[01:06.25] Tonight tonight
[01:08.61] I'm on my way
[01:11.89] I'm on my way
[01:14.46] Home sweet home
[01:21.96] 
[01:20.93] You know that I've seen
[01:23.62] Too many romantic dreams
[01:27.75] Up in lights, fallin' off
[01:31.09] The silver screen
[01:39.59] 
[01:33.24] My heart's like an open book
[01:35.88] For the whole world to read
[01:39.34] Sometimes nothing keeps me together
[01:43.74] At the seams
[01:49.74] 
[01:45.20] I'm on my way
[01:48.60] I'm on my way
[01:51.16] Home sweet home
[01:55.44] Tonight tonight
[02:02.94] 
[01:57.91] I'm on my way
[02:00.63] Just set me free
[02:03.67] Home sweet home
[02:11.17] 
[02:10.05] Home sweet home
[02:17.55] 
[02:15.86] Home sweet home
[02:23.36] 
[02:22.20] Home sweet home
[02:29.70] 
[02:53.76] I'm on my way
[02:56.70] I'm on my way
[02:59.29] Home sweet home
[03:03.86] Yeah yeah
[03:08.36] 
[03:06.19] I'm on my way
[03:09.57] Just set me free
[03:12.13] Home sweet home
